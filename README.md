Portfolio Landing Page

Welcome to my Portfolio Landing Page! This project showcases my skills, experiences, and projects as a web developer. The landing page is built with HTML and includes two versions: one using native HTML and CSS, and another styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for responsive design and fast development.
